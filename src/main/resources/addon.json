  "description": "This Addon allows you to use simple commands like \"/hub\", \"/coins\", etc. on our Minecraft-Server \"einfachmc.de\". \nOur Minecraft Server is fully Vanilla, which means there are no Plugins, only Command blocks, and Functions. Because of that, we don't have Commands like \"/hub\". To get to our Hub normally you would have to use \"/trigger hub set 1\". To query your coins \"/trigger coins set 1\". With this Addon, you can simply use \"/hub\" and \"/coins\" like you know it from other Servers.",
